    "### 1. 📌 **Executive Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal of the Project:**\n",
    "To convert raw point-of-sale (POS) transaction logs into meaningful customer insights that support data-driven marketing, pricing, and retention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Analyzed:**\n",
    "We analyzed over 500,000 retail transactions containing invoice-level sales, item descriptions, customer IDs, quantities, timestamps, and prices. These were enriched with customer-level aggregations and temporal metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Takeaways:**\n",
    "* Customers were successfully segmented based on their **lifetime value (CLTV)**, **purchase behavior (RFM)**, and **churn risk**.\n",
    "* Nearly 75% of customers fall into medium (29%) or high (44.9%%) CLTV segments, indicating strong monetization potential and a clear opportunity for targeted loyalty and upsell strategies.\n",
    "* The majority of customers fall into lower-engagement segments like **Price Shoppers** (19.1%) and **Needs Attention** (14.5%), while high-value segments like **Champions/VIPs**, **Loyal Customers**, and **Lost Cheap** make up less than **2% combined**, indicating strong potential for growth through reactivation and loyalty-building strategies.\n",
    "* The majority of customers are at **low churn risk (44.3%)**, while **31.3% are already churned**, and only a small portion face **medium (15.2%)** or **high (9.1%)** churn risk — presenting a valuable opportunity to **intervene early** with those showing signs of disengagement.\n",
    "* Approximately **31.3% of customers are churned** based on a **90-day inactivity window**, which is standard for ecommerce; this highlights a key opportunity to **win back high-value customers** (based on AOV or RFM scores), while deprioritizing recovery efforts for **low AOV or \"Lost Cheap\" segments** where ROI is minimal.\n",
    "* The overall KPIs show a healthy **average order value of €32.75** across **4,358 customers**, with a notably high **average CLTV profit of €35,537.83**, indicating that while individual purchases are moderate, certain customers contribute significantly over time. To capitalize on this, the business should focus on **identifying and nurturing high-CLTV segments**, **increasing AOV through bundling or upselling**, and **retaining top-value customers** through loyalty programs or personalized offers.\n",
    "* The engagement metrics indicate **low user activity and retention**, with an **average DAU of just 0.99**, **MAU of 29.63**, and **stickiness of 0.03**, suggesting that customers are visiting infrequently and not returning consistently — a clear signal that **activation, re-engagement, or product experience improvements** are needed to boost daily usage and loyalty.\n",
    "\n",

    "> *“We analyzed point-of-sale transaction data to identify valuable, at-risk, and disengaged customers. This enables targeted marketing, pricing, and retention strategies. We included a data dictionary to provide clarity on metrics”*\n",
